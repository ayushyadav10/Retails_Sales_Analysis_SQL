select count(*) as total_sales from retail_sales

--how many unique customers we have?
select count(distinct customer_id) as total_sale from retail_sales

--Distinct category 
select distinct category from retail_sales

--Data Analysis & Business Key Problem 

--1.Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05:

select * from retail_sales
where sale_date='2022-11-05';

--2.Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing'and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022:

select * from retail_sales
where category='Clothing'
and to_char(sale_date,'YYYY-MM')='2022-11'
and quantiy>=4

--3.Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category:

select category,sum(total_sale)as net_sale,
count(*) as total_orders
from retail_sales
group by 1

--4.Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.:

select round(avg(age),2) as avg_age
from retail_sales
where category='Beauty';

--5.Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.:

select * from retail_sales
where total_sale> 1000;

--6.Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category.:

select category,
       gender,count(*) as total_trans
from retail_sales
group by category,gender order by 1;

--7.Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year:

SELECT 
       year,
       month,
    avg_sale
FROM 
(    
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
    AVG(total_sale) as avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) as rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
) as t1
WHERE rank = 1

--8.Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales

select customer_id,sum(total_sale) as total_sales
from retail_sales
group by 1
order by 2 desc
limit 5

--9.Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category

select category,
       count(distinct customer_id) as cnt_unique_cs
from retail_sales
group by category

--10.Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)

WITH hourly_sale
AS
(
SELECT *,
    CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) < 12 THEN 'Morning'
        WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM sale_time) BETWEEN 12 AND 17 THEN 'Afternoon'
        ELSE 'Evening'
    END as shift
FROM retail_sales
)
SELECT 
    shift,
    COUNT(*) as total_orders    
FROM hourly_sale
GROUP BY shift
